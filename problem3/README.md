### Computational inefficiencies and anti-patterns found in the code block:

1. The interface 'Props' extends from interface 'BoxProps', but it does not have any changes.
   
2. In useMemo() hook, dependencies array consist: balances, prices. But 'prices' is not used in 'useMemo' callback. So, delete 'prices'

3. I think that should not use 'useMemo' hooks in this code block. Because the callback in 'useMemo' just runs after 'balances' changed value, but 'balances' is used at initialization and 'useMemo' callback. That means it does not change value after rendering
   
4. In this line: const rows = sortedBalances.map((balance: FormattedWalletBalance, index: number)
   I think it should be: const rows = formattedBalances.map((balance: FormattedWalletBalance, index: number)

5. In this line: className={classes.row}
   'classes' is not initialized
